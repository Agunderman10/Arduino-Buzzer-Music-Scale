# Arduino-Buzzer-Music-Scale
Program for the Arduino that will play through the music scale in a passive buzzer

This program will require the user to add the pitches.h library to their arduino program to run correctly. This library is included in this repo but it can also be found at https://gist.github.com/mikeputnam/2820675. Just download the ZIP file and add it to your project by going into Sketch>Include Library>Add .ZIP Library... If the program does not recognize the pitches.h file make sure you have included the file in your program.
